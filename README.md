# hello-world

Hi there Gits!

My name is Felipe and I am from Brazil! 

First of all, thank you for the warm welcome and allowing me to be part of this universe. 

I am a freshman on Computer Science degree at UoPeople. My first programming language will be Python and JavaScript. They will develop us to be a full-stacker developer, however I want to be a back-end developer.
